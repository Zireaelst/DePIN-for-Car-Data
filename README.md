## üöò Project Overview

DeCharge Network has built a decentralized marketplace for vehicle data using blockchain technology and DePIN principles. Our platform addresses a critical gap in the automotive data market - the lack of direct monetization options for vehicle owners while providing valuable data streams for researchers, insurers, urban planners, and automotive manufacturers.

Vehicle owners can securely share specific types of data (speed, location, diagnostics, etc.) and earn cryptocurrency tokens in return, while maintaining full control over what they share and with whom. Data buyers can access high-quality, real-time vehicle data from a diverse pool of sources through transparent, smart-contract-mediated transactions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Data Collection & Visualization**: Seamlessly collects and displays OBD-II data from connected vehicles, including speed, RPM, fuel level, and engine temperature.

- **Decentralized Data Marketplace**: Users can browse, buy, and sell various vehicle data packages with transparent pricing models.

- **Tokenized Rewards System**: Vehicle owners earn cryptocurrency tokens for the data they share, with earnings automatically deposited to their in-app wallet.

- **Granular Data Privacy Controls**: Users control exactly what types of data they share, how often, and for what duration.

- **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**: Visual representations of vehicle performance metrics and trip summaries help users understand their driving patterns.

- **Blockchain-Secured Transactions**: All data exchanges are secured through blockchain technology, ensuring authenticity, traceability, and tamper-proof records.

## üîß Technical Implementation

DeCharge Network's mobile app is built using:

- **React Native + Expo**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and enhanced development experience
- **AsyncStorage**: For local data caching and persistence
- **React Navigation**: For seamless screen transitions and navigation
- **Chart Components**: For visualizing vehicle data trends
- **OBD-II Integration**: For direct vehicle data collection (simulated in the prototype)
- **Smart Contract Architecture**: For handling data exchange and token rewards (implementation-ready)

## üìä Use Cases

1. **Urban Planning & Traffic Management**: Cities can purchase anonymized traffic flow data to optimize road infrastructure and reduce congestion.

2. **Insurance Companies**: Access to driving pattern data enables usage-based insurance products with fairer pricing models.

3. **Automotive Manufacturers**: Real-world vehicle performance data assists in product improvement and R&D.

4. **Fleet Management Companies**: Comprehensive data for optimizing routes, maintenance schedules, and fuel efficiency.

5. **Environmental Researchers**: Emissions and fuel consumption data supports climate research initiatives.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Connect**: Users connect their vehicles via OBD-II adapters or built-in vehicle connectivity.

2. **Control**: Vehicle owners set specific permissions for different types of data they're willing to share.

3. **Earn**: As consumers purchase data, smart contracts automatically distribute tokens to data providers.

4. **Monitor**: Users can track their earnings and data-sharing metrics through the intuitive dashboard.

## üß™ Data Types Available in Marketplace

- **Speed & Performance Data**: Speed patterns, acceleration behavior, RPM ranges
- **Location Data**: Routes, traffic conditions, regional driving patterns
- **Diagnostic Data**: Engine health, component wear, fault codes
- **Fuel/Energy Data**: Consumption patterns, efficiency metrics, charging behaviors
- **Full Vehicle Data**: Comprehensive datasets for complete vehicle analysis

## üöÄ Future Development Roadmap

- **Enhanced Data Validation**: Implement multi-point verification to ensure data authenticity
- **Advanced Analytics Tools**: Provide deeper insights into vehicle performance and driving habits
- **Expanded Data Categories**: Include additional vehicle systems and sensors
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Support multiple blockchain networks for wider adoption
- **Developer API**: Create tools for third-party developers to build on our platform
- **Hardware Integration**: Develop custom OBD-II hardware optimized for our platform

## üîó About DeCharge Network

DeCharge Network is at the forefront of bridging blockchain technology with physical vehicle data. We believe in creating a fair, transparent ecosystem where data producers (vehicle owners) are properly compensated for the valuable information they provide, while ensuring data consumers get access to high-quality, verifiable data sets.

This project was developed for the Superteam Earn Breakout Hackathon, focusing on novel applications of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) in the automotive sector.
